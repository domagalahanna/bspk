        12. Notice for California Users
      </h2>
      <p>
        Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California Service users are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
      </p>
      <h2>
        13. Dispute Resolution
      </h2>
      <p>
        <u>Arbitration</u><br>
        The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Except for disputes relating to BSPK’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents) or if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered in accordance with the then current provisions of its procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, BSPK will pay the additional cost. You and BSPK hereby expressly waive trial by jury. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if BSPK is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
        The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Class-Action Waiver</u><br>
        The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
        Exception—Litigation of Small-Claims-Court Claims
        Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
        Thirty-Day Right to Opt Out
        You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration- and class-action-waiver provisions set forth in this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: contact@bspk.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of registering to use the Service; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this Agreement. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, BSPK also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt out of these arbitration provisions, BSPK may terminate your use of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Time Limitation on Claims</u><br>
        You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with BSPK and this Agreement must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
      </p>
      <h2>
        14. Choice of Law and Forum
      </h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement and your relationship with BSPK Parties shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. Subject to Section 13, the parties irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce this Agreement in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California.
      </p>
      <h2>
        15. U.S. Government Restricted Rights
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Service shall be deemed “commercial computer software” pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <h2>
        17. Miscellaneous
      </h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and such provision will be reformed in a manner to effectuate the original intent of the parties as closely as possible and remain enforceable. If such reformation is not possible in a manner that is enforceable, then such term will be severed from the remaining terms, and the remaining terms will remain in effect. This is the entire Agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and us with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be changed, waived, or modified except by a written instrument signed by BSPK. If any employee of BSPK offers to modify this Agreement, he or she is not acting as an agent for BSPK or speaking on BSPK’s behalf. You may not rely, and should not act in reliance on, any statement or communication from an employee of BSPK or anyone else purporting to act on BSPK’s behalf. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement is between you and BSPK; there are no third-party beneficiaries. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, United States export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
